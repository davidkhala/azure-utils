- By default, it is created for you when your workspace is created. It will be named as `databricks-rg-$WorspaceName-$randomNumber`.
- It is visible as a normal Azure Resource Group
- Immutable: it is not modifiable.
  - To alter permissions on the managed resource group you need to **open a support ticket**
