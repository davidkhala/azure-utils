# geo-redundant storage (GRS)
- Active-passive: data in second region is not readable until failover.
  - Solution: **Pay** for read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): enable read access to the secondary region

# zone-redundant storage (ZRS)

# locally-redundant storage (LRS)
protect from hardware failures within a single data center (zone)
